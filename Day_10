# Day 5

Today I decided to change things up and document a question in SQL.
The problem is from Hackerrank found here : https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/15-days-of-learning-sql/problem

Julia conducted a 15 days of learning SQL contest. The start date of the contest was March 01, 2016 and the end date was March 15, 2016.

Write a query to print total number of unique hackers who made at least  submission each day (starting on the first day of the contest), and find the hacker_id and name of the hacker who made maximum number of submissions each day. If more than one such hacker has a maximum number of submissions, print the lowest hacker_id. The query should print this information for each day of the contest, sorted by the date.

To refer to the schema, please visit the link :

Here's my solution :



select 
submission_date ,

( SELECT COUNT(distinct hacker_id)  
 FROM Submissions s2  
 WHERE s2.submission_date = s1.submission_date AND    (SELECT COUNT(distinct s3.submission_date) FROM      Submissions s3 WHERE s3.hacker_id = s2.hacker_id AND s3.submission_date < s1.submission_date) = dateDIFF(s1.submission_date , '2016-03-01')) ,

(select hacker_id  from submissions s2 where s2.submission_date = s1.submission_date 
group by hacker_id order by count(submission_id) desc , hacker_id limit 1) as shit,
(select name from hackers where hacker_id = shit)
from 
(select distinct submission_date from submissions) s1
group by submission_date
