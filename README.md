# 100-Days-of-Code

I've fairly good knowledge of programming in python and Data Science. Through the next hundred days I want to brush up my Python skills, DBMS skills, and also my stats and ML all hands on by coding in Python. This is my Journey. I've decided to start from the basics, and I understand if the challenge very well goes over a 100 days because of all the things I want to learn. This is my journey, starting from Day 1.

# Day 1 : 8th Jan 2022

Starting my HDOC today
Solved for :

There's a staircase with N steps, and you can climb 1 or 2 steps at a time. Given N, write a function that returns the number of unique ways you can climb the staircase. The order of the steps matters.

For example, if N is 4, then there are 5 unique ways:

1, 1, 1, 1
2, 1, 1
1, 2, 1
1, 1, 2
2, 2
What if, instead of being able to climb 1 or 2 steps at a time, you could climb any number from a set of positive integers X? For example, if X = {1, 3, 5}, you could climb 1, 3, or 5 steps at a time. Generalize your function to take in X.


# Day 2 :  9th Jan 2022

Solved for :

Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.

For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.

Bonus: Can you do this in one pass?

# Day 3 : 10th Jan 2022

Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.

For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].

Follow-up: what if you can't use division?

Progress : got the idea to do it with and wihtout division in minutes (seconds even) but struggled with the right syntax.
